#  Project: The New Taylor Swift
### *Predicting Global Hits through Data Science & Machine Learning*

##  Overview
As junior Data Scientists for a major music label, our mission was to mathematically decode the "formula" behind global musical hits from the last few decades. Using the **Wasabi (ANR)** and **Billboard Hot 100** datasets, we explored whether success is a result of creative genius or identifiable patterns in audio features and metadata.

This project strictly follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology to ensure a rigorous and business-oriented analytical approach.

## Key Research Questions
1. **The Magic Formula:** Can we predict if a song will be a "Hit" based on audio features?
2. **Musical Cycles:** Are current pop trends just a revival of the 80s?
3. **The "Track 7" Myth:** Does a song's position in an album influence its success?
4. **The TikTok Effect:** How has social media changed song structures (chorus timing, duration)?

## Tech Stack & Methodology
* **Data Prep:** Cleaning massive datasets, feature engineering, and merging audio features with historical charts.
* **Machine Learning:** Implementation and comparison of **at least 3 models** per question (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.) with hyperparameter tuning.
* **Tools:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

##  Results & Visualizations
Here are some key insights from our analysis:

### 1. Feature Correlation
